    "2. From a PdfFileReader object, how do you get a Page object for page 5?\n",

    "Example:-\n",
    "import PyPDF2 as pdf\n",
    "pdfFileObj = open(\"cardealer.pdf\",'rb')\n",

    "Ans:- The numPages variable stores an integer of the number of pages in the PdfFileReader object.\n",

    "4. If a PdfFileReader object’s PDF is encrypted with the password swordfish, what must you do\n",

    "Ans:- we obtain the page object, the pdf has to be decrypted by calling .decrypt('swordfish')\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What methods do you use to rotate a page?\n",
    "Ans:- A page can be rotated clockwise, by 90 degrees, when displayed or printed. The Page.GetRotation() method returns the Page.\n",
