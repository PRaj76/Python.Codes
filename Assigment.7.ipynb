    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans:- The re.compile() is the responsible for  generation of  Regex objects.\n",
    "#Example:- \n",
    "import re\n",
    "x = re.compile(\"some_random_pattern\")\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "#Output:-\n",
    "re.compile('some_random_pattern')\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Ans:- Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped. \n",
    "      The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "Ans:- The re.search() function takes two parameters and returns a match object if there is a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is more than one match, only the first occurrence of the match will be returned. \n",
    "If no matches are found, the value None is returned.\n",
    "#Example:-\n",
    "import re\n",
    "txt = \"Millie Finn Gaten\"\n",
    "sub_str = re.search(\"\\s\", txt)\n",
    "print(\"The first white-space character is located in position:\", sub_str.start())\n",
    "\n",
    "#Output:-\n",
    "The first white-space character is located in position: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "Ans:- The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",
    "#Example:-\n",

    "555-4242\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "Ans:- Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
    "        \n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
    "the two options?\n",
    "Ans:- If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. \n",
    "      If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "Ans:- In Standard Expressions | means OR operator.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",

    "    using a specialized syntax held in a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "Ans:-  In Regular Expressions, * Represents Zero ore more occurances of the preceeding group, whereas\n",
    "    + represents one or more occurances of the preceeding group.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "Ans:- The {4} matches exactly three instances of the preceding group. The {4,5} matches between three\n",
    "    and five instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    " Ans:- The \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word, or space character,\n",
    "         respectively.\n",
    "            \n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "Ans:- The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or \n",
    "        space character, respectively.\n",
    "        \n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "Ans:- .* is a Greedy mode, which returns the longest string that meets the condition.\n",
    "    Whereas .*? is a non greedy mode which returns the shortest string that meets the condition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "Ans:- The Synatax is Either [a-z0-9] or [0-9a-z]\n",

    "    \n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd\n",
    "    argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "Ans:- The . character normally matches any character except the newline character.\n",
    "    If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match \n",
    "    newline characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('x','11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen')\n",
