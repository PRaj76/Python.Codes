    "2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?\n",
    "Ans:- You can import the module with import pyinputplus as pyip so that you can enter a shorter name when calling the module’s functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyInputPlus has functions for entering a variety of input, including strings, numbers, dates, yes/no, True/False, emails, and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?\n",
    "Ans:-   inputInt() : Accepts an integer value. This also takes additional parameters ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘greaterThan’ and ‘lessThan’  for bounds. Returns an int.\n",
    "        inputFloat() : Accepts a floating-point numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:-\n",
    "import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
    "pyip.inputInt()\n",
    "pyip.inputFloat()\n",
    "\n",
    "#Output:-\n",
    "6.7\n",
    "'6.7' is not an integer.\n",
    "66\n",
    "65\n",
    "65.0\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?\n",
    "Ans:- In the inputint function we can set the min = 0 and max =99 to ensure user enters number between 0 and 99\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #Example:- \n",
    "    pyip.inputInt(min = 0, max =99)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #Output:-\n",
    "    777\n",
    "    Number must be at maximum 99.\n",
    "    66\n",
    "    66\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?\n",
    "Ans:-  The allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword arguments take a list of regular expression strings \n",
    "    to determine what the PyInputPlus function will accept or reject as valid input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?\n",
    "Ans:- The statement inputStr(limit=3) will throw two exceptions ValidationException and \n",
    "    RetryLimitException. The first exception is thrown because blank values are not allowed by \n",
    "    inputStr() function by default. it we want to consider blank values as valid input, we have to \n",
    "    set blank=True.\n",
    "The second exception is occured because we have reached the max limit we have specified by using \n",
    "limit parameter. inorder to avoid this exception we can use default parameter to return a default \n",
    "value when max limit is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, defaul='hello') do?\n",
    "Ans:- Since the default parameter is set to hello. after blank input is entered three times instead \n",
    "    of raising RetryLimitException exception. the function will return hello as response to the \n",
    "     calling function\n",
    " \n",
