    "1.What exactly is [ ]?\n",
    "Ans: The empty list represented by [] is a list that contains no items. \n",
    "    This is similar to '' which represents an empty string\n",
    "\n",
    "2.In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "Ans: spam[2]='hello' (Note: Lists follows zero based indexing)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:-\n",
    "spam=[2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "print(spam)\n",
    "spam[2]='hello' #List uses zero based indexing\n",

    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a','b','c',d'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3'*2)//11)] ?\n",
    "Ans: 'd' (Note that '3' * 2 is the string '33', which is passed to int() before being divided by 11. \n",
    "    This eventually evaluates to 3, spam[3] is equal to d.)\n",
    "#Example:-\n",
    "spam=['a','b','c','d']\n",

    "spam[int(int('3'*2)//11)] -> d\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Ans: 'd' (Lists support Negative indexing, Hence spam[-1] returs 'd')\n",

    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14,'cat',11,'cat',True] for the next three question.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans: The value of bacon.index('cat') is 1 (Note: index method returns the index of first occuerence of 'cat')\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:-\n",
    "bacon=[3.14,'cat',11,'cat',True]\n",

    "#Output:-\n",
    "bacon.index('cat') -> 1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Ans: The append method adds new elements to the end of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:-\n",
    "print(bacon)\n",
    "bacon.append(99) # appends 99 to the end of the list\n",

    "[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans: The remove method removes the first occurence of the element in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:-\n",
    "print(bacon)\n",
    "bacon.remove('cat')\n",
    "print(bacon)\n",

    "[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "9.what are the list concatenation and list replication operations?\n",
    "Ans: The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *. \n",
    "    (This is the same as for strings.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:-\n",
    "list_1 = ['PA','NK','AJ','VI','SHA']\n",
    "list_2 = ['WAK','KAM','RAA']\n",
    "print(list_1 + list_2) # List Concatenation\n",
    "print(list_2*2) # List Replication\n",

    "['PA', 'NK', 'AJ', 'VI', 'SHA', 'WAK', 'KAM', 'RAA']\n",
    "['WAK', 'KAM', 'RAA', 'WAK', 'KAM', 'RAA']\n",
    "\n",
    "10.what is the difference between the list method append() and insert()?\n",
    "Ans: While append() will add values only to the end of a list, \n",
    "    insert() can add them anywhere in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Examples:-\n",
    "list = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "list.append(6)\n",
    "print(list)\n",
    "list.insert(2,'Demo')\n",
    "print(list)\n",

    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "[1, 2, 'Demo', 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans: The del statement and the remove() method are two ways to remove values from a list\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans: Both lists and strings can be passed to len() function, have indexes and slices,\n",
    "    be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans: Lists are Mutable, Indexable and Slicable. they can have values added, removed, or changed. \n",
    "    Tuples are Immutable but Indexable and Slicable. the tuple values cannot be changed at all.\n",
    "    Also, tuples are represented using parentheses, (), while lists use the square brackets, [].\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans:(42,) (The trailing comma is mandatory. otherwise its considered as a int by python Interpreter)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Example:-\n",
    "tup1=(42)\n",
    "tup2=(42,)\n",
    "print(type(tup1))\n",
    "print(type(tup2))\n",
    "\n",
    "#Output:-\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    "<class 'tuple'>\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Ans: The tuple() and list() functions, respectively are used to convert a list to tuple and vice versa\n",
    "    \n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Ans: They contain references to list values.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Ans: The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. \n",
    "    That is, only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any lists inside the list."
