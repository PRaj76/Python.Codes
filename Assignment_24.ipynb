    "1.What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Lambda Function, also referred to as ‘Anonymous function’ is same as a regular python function but \n",
    "    can be defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, anonymous \n",
    "    functions are defined using the lambda keyword. However,they are restricted to single line of \n",
    "    expression. They can take in mutliple parameters as in regular functions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "The following are some of the benefits of lambda expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    ">.Can be used to create Nameless/Anonymous functions inside some complex functions if we are\n",
    "planning to use it only once.\n",
    ">.Moderate to small functions can be created in a single line\n",
    ">.Fuctions created using lambda expressions can be assigned to a variable and can be used by\n",
    "simply calling the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    map applies as a transformation to an element. The map() function iterates through all items\n",
    "    in the given iterable and executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them.\n",
    "    Syntax : map(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "filter accumulates only elements matching a condition. filter() forms a new list that contains \n",
    "only elements that satisfy a certain condition, i.e. the function we passed returns True\n",
    "Syntax : filter(function, iterable(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce accumulates all elements to a single value, by using immutable values reduce() works by\n",
    "calling the function we passed for the first two items in the sequence. The result returned \n",
    "by the function is used in another call to function alongside with the next (third in this case), \n",
    "element Syntax : reduce(function, sequence[, initial])\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary \n",
    "pythoncexpressions at compile time.\n",
    "Annotations of simple parameters def func(x: expression, y: expression = 20):\n",
    "Whereas the annotations for excess parameters are as − \n",
    "def func (**args: expression,  **kwargs: expression): \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    A recursive function is a function in code that refers to itself for execution. \n",
    "    Recursive functions can be simple or elaborate. They allow for more efficient code writing, \n",
    "    for instance, in the listing or compiling of sets of numbers, strings or other variables through \n",
    "    a single reiterated process\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "Ans:-Some of the general design guidelines for coding functions are:\n",
    "        \n",
    ">.Always use a docstring to explain the functionality of the function\n",
    ">.avoid using or limited use of global variables\n",
    ">.Proper Identation to increase the code readability\n",
    ">.try to follow a naming convention for function names (pascalCase or camelCase) and stick with the\n",
    "same convention throughout the application.\n",
    ">.Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name\n",
    ">.try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function\n",
    ">.Local variables should be named using camelCase format (ex: localVariable) whereas Global variables\n",
    "names should be using PascalCase (ex:GlobalVariable).\n",
    ">.Constant should be represented in allcaps (ex:CONSTANT).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
    "Ans:-The ways in which a function can communicate with the calling function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "print\n",
    "return\n",
    "yield\n",
